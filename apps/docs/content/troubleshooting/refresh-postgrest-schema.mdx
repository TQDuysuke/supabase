To refresh your PostgREST schema, go to your project **Dashboard**, and open the **SQL Editor**.

Then, paste the following SQL statement:

```sql
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
```

And click on **Run**.

You should see a confirmation message under the **Results** tab:

```
Success. No rows returned
```
