title: Empty states
description: Empty states help users understand when there is no data to display, and what to do about it.
---

Done right, empty states:

- Convey the fact that there are no children to display
- Make the value of the feature clear
- Make it clear how to add a child

That means empty states are only appropriate in areas where we would otherwise show a list of children.

## Components

There is not yet a shared empty state UI component. As of writing this, the context and needs for each placement differ enough to warrant custom components for each placement. That said, we should aim to make these as consistent as possible over time and , see the below examples and share common logic in a centralised component.

## Examples

- [EmptyBucketState](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/storage/analytics) shown when there are no buckets under Storage
- Branch Management EmptyStates
- [FunctionsEmptyState](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/functions) shown when there are no functions
- [CronJobsEmptyState](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/integrations/cron/jobs) shown when there are no cron jobs
