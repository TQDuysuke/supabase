<ComponentPreview name="data-input-demo" peekCode wide />

Referred to as `Input` in code. Not to be confused with the `Input`component from`@/components/ui/input`.

## Usage

The Data Input component is a workhorse.

### Read-only values

<ComponentPreview name="data-input-with-copy" className="[&_input]:max-w-xs" />

An optional button positioned absolutely to the inputâ€™s right side. Choices include:

1. Copy (Copied): does not reveal the value (if hidden)
2. Reveal -> reveals the value and then button changes to Copy (Copied)

We restrict it to only one button that shares roles to simplify the user experience. After all, the use case for _only_ revealing and not copying is rare.

### Sensitive values

<ComponentPreview name="data-input-with-reveal-copy" className="[&_input]:max-w-xs" />

You can also partially truncate the value by adding a placeholder value.

### Password managers

You may need to add the following attribute to your input to prevent password managers from autofilling the value:

```html
data-1p-ignore data-lpignore="true" data-form-type="other" data-bwignore
```

They tend to attach themselves to inputs with id="name" or `data-form-type="password"` attributes.
